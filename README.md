Trancriptome analysis with NGS datasets from Homarus Americanus. 
Diverses tissues data from H. americanus were retrieved on the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) server. 
A sequencing reports using the FastQC tool was used to assess the quality of the raw sequencing reads. 
Removing of low quality reads, sequencing adapters, over-represented sequences were done using the Trimmomatic and Cutadapt tools. 
The assembly of the transcriptome was done using the BWA-MEM algorithm from the BWA tool. 
Since no assembled genome was available for H. americanus, we use Penaeus vannamei (Pacific white shrimp) a closer species as reference genome for the transcritpme assembly of H. americanus.
